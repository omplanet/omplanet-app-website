          <h2>OUR VISION</h2>
          <h2>New Earth Directory Connecting Starseeds and Centers of New Life</h2>
          <p>
          	In the midst of this accelerated time of changes, many collectives and individuals from all over the world are stepping forward as radiant examples of a new way of being, building foundations for a new society and a New Life.<br/>
          	<br/>
          	In many corners of the world there are thousands of initiatives, spiritual communities and conscious movements where people come together to co-create and transform, to celebrate and share their gifts - cultivating freedom, joy, abundance, love and caring for each other and our Planet. Amazing environments and collectives where conscious transformation and spiritual development is a priority, where the intention is to grow in harmony and greater wholeness with All.<br/>
          	<br/>
          	In 2008, through some interesting synchronicities, we have come together with 3 friends from Armenia, Russia and Germany to initiate a project called "The City of 12". It was intended to build one such environment described as - "A New City for New Humans to grow in Truth, Love and Freedom". Although at that time we did not have enough resources and experiences and our dream project did not come to fruition, we have witnessed the emergence of similar initiatives in other places of the world. And then there was a spark of a great inspiration and intention to <strong>connect them all!<strong/><br/>
          	<br/>
          	That intention has been transformed and evolved many times in the past 10 years, and now it is expressed as this platform, this is a co-creation in progress.
          </p>
          <h2>Empowering rather than Distracting</h2>
          <p>
          	We are not a business that measures its success based on how much profit it makes. We don't put making profit above serving our members! We just love creating and exchanging our gifts!<br/>
          	<br/>
          	We do not treat you as an addicted Facebook user by suggesting you attractive content for endless scrolling to keep you using our apps and waste your precious time for minimal satisfaction.<br/>
          	<br/>
          	We want you to find what might bring you joy in real life as soon as possible and to go spend time on that real life activity and real human interaction.<br/>
          	<br/>
          	We highlight places and experiences that are transformational, that bring people together, or empower people to find warmth and loving support just a click away.<br/>
