            <h2>OUR VISION</h2>
            <h4>Global Celebration with all of Humanity</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Envision the tribe of humanity expanding in a massive ecstatic celebration across the planet, embracing all and everyone in unified love!!!</strong>
            </p>
            <h4>Building the Foundations of the New Earth</h4>
            <p>
              We are united by purpose, by something bigger than ourselves, an intention to bring humanity into a new world of love, abundance and unity, we are building the foundations of the New Earth.<br/>
              <br/>
              In the midst of this accelerated time of changes, many collectives and individuals from all over the world are stepping forward as radiant examples of a new way of being, a new way of living, with consideration, caring for each other and our planet, harmonizing, cultivating freedom, joy, abundance, Love and Unity. This is what New Earth is built on, this is the foundation that we want to build our reality on.
            </p>
            <h4>Linking up the New Earth Seeds</h4>
            <p>
              In many corners of the world there are thousands of initiatives, conscious movements or spiritual communities where people come together to co-create and transform, to celebrate and share their gifts.<br/>
              <br/>
              Over the past 10 years we were presencing the emergence of such initiatives in many parts of the world. And there was a sense of a collective dream and inspiration to <strong>connect everyone through a unified ecosystem!</strong><br/>
              <br/>
              This inspiration has been transformed and evolved many times in the past 10 years, and now it is expressed as this platform, this is a co-creation in progress, a quest.
            </p>
            <h4>“Be the Change You Want to See"</h4>
            <p>
              The journey starts from transforming ourselves first, living by example, as an individual as well as a collective! We experiment with new integrative organizational models such as Holacracy and Radiant Organizations — and we are open to paths, still hidden, that emerge as we progress.

          <h2>OUR PRINCIPLES</h2>
          <ul>
      <li><h4>Highest Good of All</h4>We recognize that we are One with humanity and all of life, all inherently connected and interdependent. Coming from this realization our intention is to play a win-win-win game - for the company shareholders, for the individual or collective stakeholders and for the environment serving the highest good of all in a virtuous cycle. 
      </li>
      <li><h4>Conscious Business</h4>Good intention is not enough, we realize the need to be conscious throughout the creative process. We do inquiry of the overall impact of our business on the world on all different aspects and we are committed to continue this inquiry over time. And as we care about creating positive impact in the outside world, we take care as well about raising the awareness and consciousness of our own team members throughout the process.

      </li>
      <li><h4>Empowering Technology</h4>
        Humanity embraces technology to accelerate its evolution but we can also become slaves to it. We will use technology with responsibility and direct it to help us all find truth, joy and authentic human connection.<br/>
