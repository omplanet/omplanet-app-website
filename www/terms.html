We commit to not track your data (except for the limited purposes of operating, developing, providing, and improving the Service and researching and developing new ones), and to not sell your personal data to any 3rd party for advertizing or any other purposes (except when for your benefit with your explicit consent).</p>

          <h2>TERMS OF SERVICE</h2>
          <p>Last revised on March 17, 2019</p>
          <p>Welcome to OmPlanet (the “Platform”), which is provided by omplanet.net (referred to as “OmPlanet”, “we” or “us”). Thank you for taking the time to read it.</p>

          <h4>1. Acceptance of Terms of Use Agreement.</h4>
          <p>
            By creating a OmPlanet account or by using any OmPlanet service, whether through a mobile device, mobile application or computer (collectively, the “Service”) you agree to be bound by (i) these Terms of Service, (ii) our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, each of which is incorporated by reference into this Agreement, and (iii) any terms disclosed to you if you purchase or have purchased additional features, products or services we offer on the Service (collectively, this “Agreement”). If you do not accept and agree to be bound by all of the terms of this Agreement, you should not use the Service.
          </p>

          <h4>2. Who Can Use OmPlanet</h4>
          <p>
            We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be safe, secure, and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the OmPlanet community.
            <ul>
              <li>
                You must be at least 13 years old.
              </li>
              <li>
                You don't have to disclose your identity to OmPlanet, but you must provide us with accurate and up to date information (including registration information). Also, you may not impersonate someone you aren't, and you can't create an account for someone else unless you have their express permission.
              </li>
              <li>
                You can't attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in unauthorized ways. This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way without our express permission.
              </li>
              <li>
                We must not have previously disabled your account for violation of law or any of our policies.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h4>3. Your Account</h4>
          <p>
            In order to use OmPlanet, you may sign in using your Facebook login. If you do so, you authorize us to access and use certain Facebook account information. For more information regarding the information we collect from you and how we use it, please consult our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.<br/>
            <br/>
            You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials you use to sign up for OmPlanet, and you are solely responsible for all activities that occur under those credentials. If you think someone has gained access to your account, please immediately contact info@omplanet.net
          </p>

          <h4>4. Modifying the Service and Termination</h4>
          <p>
            OmPlanet is always striving to improve the Service and bring you additional functionality that you will find engaging and useful. This means we may add new product features or enhancements from time to time as well as remove some features, and if these actions do not materially affect your rights or obligations, we may not provide you with notice before taking them. We may even suspend the Service entirely, in which event we will notify you in advance unless extenuating circumstances, such as safety or security concerns, prevent us from doing so.<br/>
            <br/>
            You may terminate your account at any time, for any reason, by following the instructions in “Settings” in the Service or contacting us by email, however if you use a third party payment account, you will need to manage in app purchases through such account (e.g., iTunes, Google Play) to avoid additional billing.<br/>
            <br/>
            OmPlanet may terminate your account at any time without notice if it believes that you have violated this Agreement. Upon such termination, you will not be entitled to any refund for purchases.

          </p>

          <p>
