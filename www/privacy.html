          <h2>OUR COMMITMENT TO YOU</h2>
          <p>At OMPlanet privacy is a top priority and we design all of our products and services with your privacy in mind! We do not claim ownership of your content. We commit to not track your data (except for the limited purposes of operating, developing, providing, and improving the Service and researching and developing new ones), and to not sell your personal data to any 3rd party for advertizing or any other purposes (except when for your benefit with your explicit consent).</p>

          <h2>PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
          <p>Effective date: May 1, 2019</p>
          <p>Welcome to OMPlanet’s Privacy Policy. Thank you for taking the time to read it.</p>

          <h4>1. WHO WE ARE</h4>
          <p>The organisation that is responsible for your information under this Privacy Policy (the “data controller”) is:</p>
          <p>OMPlanet</br>
            17 rue des Thermopyles,</br>
            75014 Paris,</br>
            France
          </p>

          <h4>2. WHERE THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLIES</h4>
          <p>This Privacy Policy applies to websites, apps, events and other services operated by OMPlanet. For simplicity, we refer to all of these as our “services” in this Privacy Policy. To make it extra clear, we’ve added links to this Privacy Policy on all applicable services.</p>

          <h4>3. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h4>
          <p>
            To help you have meaningful interactions with others we need some information about you that can be used to contact or identify you ("Personal Data"). Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to: basic profile details and information from your social media account. If you want additional info, we go into more detail below.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>When you create an account, you provide us with at least your login credentials, as well as some basic details necessary for the service to work, such as your hometown, gender and date of birth.</li>
            <li>When you complete your profile, you can share with us additional information, such as details on your personality, lifestyle, interests and other details about you, as well as content such as photos and videos. To add certain content, like pictures or videos, you may allow us to access your camera or photo album.</li>
            <li>When you subscribe to a paid service or make a purchase directly from us (rather than through a platform such as iOS or Android), you provide us or our payment service provider with information, such as your debit or credit card number or other financial information.</li>
            <li>If you ask us to communicate with or otherwise process information of other people (for example, if you ask us to send an email on your behalf to the host of a place or an event), we collect the information that you give us in order to complete your request.</li>
            <li>We also programatically process your chats with other users as well as the content you publish, as part of the operation of the services.</li>
            <li>You may be able to use your social media login (such as Facebook Login) to create and log into your OMPlanet account. This saves you from having to remember yet another user name and password and allows you to share some information from your social media account with us.</li>
            <li>If you give us permission, we can collect your precise geolocation (latitude and longitude) through various means, depending on the service and device you’re using, including GPS, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connections. The collection of your geolocation may occur in the background even when you aren’t using the services if the permission you gave us expressly permits such collection. If you decline permission for us to collect your geolocation, we will not collect it.</li>
            <li>We may collect the following information from and about the device(s) you use to access our services: hardware and software information such as IP address, device ID and type, device-specific characteristics, app crashes, advertising IDs (such as Google’s AAID and Apple's IDFA, both of which are randomly generated numbers that you can reset by going into your device’ settings), browser type, version and language, operating system, time zones, identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies that may uniquely identify your device or browser (e.g., IMEI/UDID and MAC address) and other diagnostic data.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>4. TRACKING & COOKIES DATA</h4>
          <p>We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to track the activity on our Service and hold certain information for functional purposes and ti improve our services.</p>

          <p>Your information, including Personal Data, may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ than those from your jurisdiction.</p>
          <p>If you are located outside France and choose to provide information to us, please note that we transfer the data, including Personal Data, to France and process it there.</p>
          <p>Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>
          <p>OMPlanet will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and no transfer of your Personal Data will take place to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place including the security of your data and other personal information.</p>

          <h4>7. DISCLOSURE OF DATA</h4>

          <p>OMPlanet may disclose your Personal Data for legal requirements in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:</p>

          </ul>

          <h4>8. SECURITY OF DATA</h4>
          <p>We work hard to protect you from unauthorized access to or alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information. As with all technology companies, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information will always remain secure. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>

          <h4>9. HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION</h4>
          <ul>
              <li>
                <h4>With other Users</h4>
                <p>You share information with other users when you voluntarily disclose information on the service (including your public profile). Please be careful with your information and make sure that the content you share is stuff that you’re comfortable being publically viewable since neither you nor we can control what others do with your information once you share it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you choose to limit the audience for all or part of your profile or for certain content or information about you, then it will be visible according to your settings.

            <p>These third parties have access to your Personal Data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
